Hi r/cfb,

It's been a long, crazy off-season. Idk about you but conference realignment has got me feeling down. I figured some dumb statistical analysis would cheer me up heading into the weekend

**Is Ryan Day a better coach during the day time or night time?**
Pretty simple question. Under Ryan Day how do the Buckeyes fare during the day time vs at night?

### Data Collection
I scraped *THE* Ohio State's schedule and results from [football-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/ohio-state/2019-schedule.html). For some reason, the 2019 page did not include game start times, so I filled in my resulting csv file with start times listed [here](https://fbschedules.com/2019-ohio-state-football-schedule/)

### Data
The table below shows Ryan Day's results by game type (Day/Night). In all, he wins **93.75 %** of his day games and **82.35 %** of his night games.

GameType	| Loss | Win	
:--:|:--:|:--:
Day | 2 | 30
Night | 3 | 14

#### SoS Day vs Night
One thing that jumped out to me was whether or not tOSU simply plays more unranked opponents during the day time.
